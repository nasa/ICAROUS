Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of
Unmanned Systems (ICAROUS)
========

ICAROUS (Independent Configurable Architecture for Reliable Operations of
Unmanned Systems) is a software architecture that enables the robust integration
of mission specific software modules and highly assured core software
modules for building safety-centric autonomous unmanned aircraft
applications. The set of core software modules includes formally
verified algorithms that detect, monitor, and control conformance
to safety criteria; avoid stationary obstacles and maintain a safe
distance from other users of the airspace; and compute resolution
and recovery maneuvers, autonomously executed by the autopilot, when
safety criteria are violated or about to be violated. ICAROUS is implemented using the
NASA's core Flight Systems (cFS) middleware. The aforementioned functionalities are implemented as
cFS applications which interact via a publish/subscribe messaging
service provided by the cFS Software Bus.

### REQUIRED PACKAGES

The following repositories are required to run (or support software-in-the-loop tests for) ICAROUS (You will also have to update the submodules in these repositories if available)

- [Ardupilot](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot.git) (Only required for software in the loop simulations)
- [mavlink](https://github.com/ArduPilot/mavlink.git) 
- [MAVProxy](https://github.com/ArduPilot/MAVProxy.git)
- [NLOPT](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (required only if using splines based path planner)

### Initialize and update submodules

```
    $git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### COMPILING ICAROUS

ICAROUS makes use of the cmake build system. In order to setup a build, the following environment variables must be defined. These can be added to you `~/.bashrc` script.

- PLEXIL_HOME= absolute path to the C++/Modules/Plexil folder found in the Icarous repository.
- OSAL_HOME= absolute path to the CFS/osal folder found in the Icarous repository.
- JAVA_HOME= absolute path to the Java installation directory. Typically located under `/usr/lib/jvm/java-*`
- NLOPT_PATH = absolute path to the nlopt library location (libnlopt.a) [Optional-only required if splines based planner is being used].

```
    $mkdir build
    $cd build && cmake ..
    $make cpu1-install
```

Run cmake with `-DSITL=ON` option to compile for software-in-the-loop simulations. Use `-DSPLINES=ON` to compile splines planner (This requires the nlopt library).

For compilation and linking errors related to missing libraries, check [Modules/README.md](Modules/README.md).


### LAUNCHING ICAROUS

The generated executable file is installed under `cFS/bin/cpu1`. Launch Icarous using the following command:

```
    $sudo ./core-cpu1
```

Note that you need root previleges. When running ICAROUS on an embedded platform, one can make use of the `nohup` or `screen` command to avoid termination when a terminal is closed.

The intf_tbl.c located under `cFS/apps/interface/fsw/tables` defines parameters required to configure the serial port settings to connect to an autopilot. 

The various parameters that control the behavior of ICAROUS can be found in `cFS/bin/ram/icarous.txt`. The default parameters found in icarous.txt were selected after several flight tests to yield acceptable performances.

### INTERACTING WITH ICAROUS

We strongly recommend using MAVProxy as a ground station to communicate with ICAROUS. The custom MAVProxy modules provided in `Python/CustomModules` help upload geofence and visualize track bands.

- Install the custom modules provided as part of the ICAROUS repository:

```
    $cd Python/CustomModules
    $bash SetuMavProxy.sh <Location of MAVProxy/>
```

The MAVProxy ground station can be lauched using the run script located under the Scripts folder:

    $./runGS.sh

Waypoints can be uploaded from MAVProxy using the `wp` command, e.g.,

	wp load Examples/InputData/flightplan.txt

Geofence can be uploaded from MAVProxy using the `geofence` command, e.g.,

	geofence load Examples/InputData/geofence.xml
	
Once waypoints and geofence are uploaded, the mission can be started from MAVProxy as follows:

    long MISSION_START

### RUNNING ICAROUS WITH THE ARDUPILOT SITL

Setup and launch the ardupilot SITL as described in <http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html>. By default, the ardupilot SITL is configured to output packets to udp port 14551. To interface Icarous with the ardupilot SITL, generate the SITL build and compile as follows:

```
    $mkdir build-stil
    $cd build-sitl && cmake .. -DSITL=ON
    $make cpu1-install
```

### DDS APP FOR ICAROUS (Optional)

ICAROUS provides an application to communicate using OpenSplice DDS. Enable this application as follows:

1. Download and install an OpenSplice DDS 32bit version

2. Create an OpenSplice configuration file (.xml) with **domain id** 100.  Follow the examples provided in the OpenSplice DDS distribution directory within `etc/conf`.

3. Add `dds_interface` to the `TGT1_APPLIST` in the file `cFS/apps/Icarous_defs/targets.cmake` to compile the dds application:

4. Define the following environment variable for building:

     - `OSPL_HOME`: the path of the OpenSplice local installation; for example, `/opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux`

5. Define the following environment variables before executing ICAROUS:

     - `OSPL_URI`: the URI of the OpenSplice `*.xml` configuration file for **domain id** 100 (the one of *Step 2*); for example, `file:///opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux/etc/icarous-ospl.xml` (note the three initial slashes)
     - `OSPL_HOME`: the path of the OpenSplice local installation; for example, `/opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux`
     - `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`: it has to include the library path of the OpenSplice local installation in order for ICAROUS to find them; for example, `/opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux/lib`

   An example command could look like this:
   
```
OSPL_URI="file:///opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux/etc/icarous-ospl.xml" \
OSPL_HOME="/opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux" \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/opt/OpenSplice/HDE/x86.linux/lib" \
sudo ./core-cpu1
```


### Detect and Avoid (DAA) and Geofencing Capabilities

ICAROUS integrates NASA's open source software packages [DAIDALUS](http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/DAIDALUS)
(Detect and Avoid Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems) and
[PolyCARP](http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/PolyCARP) (Algorithms and Software
for Computations with Polygons). DAIDALUS provides detect and avoid
capabilities, while PolyCARP provides geofencing capabilities.
